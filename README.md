It uses simplest panoramic camera frame, which including 2 fisheye camera modules (fov > 180), and computing unite to generate panoramic image from two circular images from fisheye cameras. It uses one Raspberry Pi W (RPi0W) and one Raspberry Pi Zero (w) (RPi0). The RPi0 acts as USB gadget slave, ready to recieve the commands from RPi0W. The RPi0W is used as the master pi, which do the UI on WiFi, get image from slave Pi and generate panoramic image from two circular images. The kit offered the USB and power connection between two Pis, so no other usb cables needed.

The algorithm is not very straightforward, here is the [link](http://paulbourke.net/dome/fish2/) which introdcued how to map a circular image into panoramic image. In a short word, the algorithm mapped the circular image into sphere (3D x,y,z) and then mapped the sphere into panoramic image. For the better understanding, the world map is an excellent example, it maps the earth (3D sphere in the space) into 2D world map, and this map is panomaric image. In this article, it also introduced the several APIs, however, I wrote this algorithm in python by myself just for better understanding. The 360 panoramic image was generated by adding 2 180 pano image side by side and use a filter to smooth the boundray. 

## Step 0 - Prepare the Raspberry Pi Zero 

In this section, the dual RPis camera system will be set up. Dual RPis system communicate via USB Ethernet. 

For both RPi, flash latest Raspbian lite (desktop could be fine, but it is not necessary.). Once Raspbian if flashed, open up the boot partition and add new file ssh to enable the ssh on boot. The different setting between master and slave RPi is as follows.

### Slave Pi, Pi zero 
  
1. Follow the instructions to set up the USBGadget. The full instruction can be found in [here](http://blog.gbaman.info/?p=791).  In short, here is the steps copied from that instruction. 

  _For this method, alongside your Pi Zero, MicroUSB cable and MicroSD card, only an additional computer is required, which can be running Windows (with Bonjour, iTunes or Quicktime installed), Mac OS or Linux (with Avahi Daemon installed, for example Ubuntu has it built in)._

  * _Flash Raspbian Jessie full or Raspbian Jessie Lite onto the SD card_

  * _Once Raspbian is flashed, open up the boot partition (in Windows Explorer, Finder etc) and add to the bottom of the config.txt file dtoverlay=dwc2 on a new line, then save the file._

  * _If using a recent release of Jessie (Dec 2016 onwards), then create a new file simply called ssh in the SD card as well. By default SSH is now disabled so this is required to enable it. Remember - Make sure your file doesn't have an extension (like .txt etc)!_

  * _Finally, open up the cmdline.txt. Be careful with this file, it is very picky with its formatting! Each parameter is seperated by a single space (it does not use newlines). Insert modules-load=dwc2,g_ether after rootwait. To compare, an edited version of the cmdline.txt file at the time of writing, can be found here._

  * _That's it, eject the SD card from your computer, put it in your Raspberry Pi Zero and connect it via USB to your computer. It will take up to 90s to boot up (shorter on subsequent boots). It should then appear as a USB Ethernet device. You can SSH into it using raspberrypi.local as the address._
  
2. Install the rpi cam web interface, better to follow the instructions [here](https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface). When you install the rpi web cam interface, there will be a step for you to choose some configurations. One of them is to set up the install directory. The default directory is _html_, change it to _picam_. The benefit is that the default could be used for other projects. And I hard coded the image directory to _picam_. So for time saving sake, change **html** to **picam**. 
  
  * _**TP**: connect the slave pi to the PC, open a browser, input raspberrypi.local/picam  if shown the live stream, it means it works._

### Master Pi, Pi Zero W

1. Set up the wireless. 

  Still in the boot partition, add the file **wpa_supplicant.conf** and add the following lines and replace SSID and PASSWORD with the ones for your network:

        ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
        update_config=1
        network={
            ssid="SSID"
            psk="PASSWORD"
        }

2. Setup USBNet

  Boot the master RPi and add the following line at the end of the file /etc/network/interfaces

        auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback

        iface eth0 inet manual

        allow-hotplug wlan0
        iface wlan0 inet manual
            wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
       
  Reboot the mater pi.

2. Install the rpi web cam interface. The same as the slave pi. 
  
  * _**TP**: connect RPi0W to your WiFi, open a browser, check the IP and input the http://rpi-ip/picam. If shown the live stream, it worded._

## Step 1 - Software Setup

1. Follow the order of install.list to install the needed packages in RPi0W. In short
  * sudo apt-get install python-opencv
  * sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
  * sudo apt-get install python-pip
  * sudo apt-get install python-numpy
  * sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
  * sudo pip install pillow

2. Clone this git and test
  * git clone https://github.com/rpicamera/360pano.git

  * _**TP**: Test the regression code. Run the following line. If no error message and it generate the sample pano image named **regression.png** as follows, it worked._

  ```python
  python regression.py
  ```

  </p>
  
## Step 2 - Setup the kit

1. Introduction of 2PiView kit

  * 2PiView main frame offered the build in connection of USB and Power shareing. The pin is used to do the physical connection. The following shows the frame. Also it is used for the camera stand.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/rpicamera/2PiViewMedia/blob/master/img/frame.png" width="500"/>
  </p>

  * The outside stand protect the frame and let it stand on the surface. The set up overlook is as follows.

    <img src="https://github.com/rpicamera/2PiViewMedia/blob/master/img/side.png"  height="400"/>
  </div>

2. Setup steps

  * soldering the pins

  * screw the Pi Zero and camera modules to the frame.

3. Test the connection

  * connect the power to the RPi0 (slave pi), and connect to RPi0W using ssh

  * ping raspberrypi.local, if the ip address was start from 169. then it works

## Step 3 - Setup HTML interface

1. copy files
  
  In this step, the root access is needed (sudo ). Here assume the RPi-Web-Cam-Interface install directory is _picam_.

  * copy all files in _/picam_ except for _aframe.min.js_ to the /var/www/picam . 

  * copy _aframe.min.js_ to /var/www/picam/js/aframe.min.js_

  * create the directory named _img_

  * create the directory names _imghelp_

  * copy _../img/panowd.jpg_ into _picam/img_

  * return to _/var/www_ and run the command:

    ```
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data <rpi-web-cam-interface>
    ```
  * go to directory and test the python setting by
 
    ```
        sudo python genpano.py
    ```
    
  wait for it finished, go to _img_ and check is there a new file. If passed the test, it means it worked. 

2. Initial the system

  Because every single camera may not be the same. So the circular image may not located on the default place. In this step, using html interface, the configure file will be generated and saved to the local. 

  * Open a browser and url: _ip/picam/crophelper.php  . Here the program will shoot two photos and show it on the page.

  * Input the value in the text box to move the red circle such that the circule could match the boundary of the cirular image.

  * Click save button to save the configuration

3. Try the whole system

  After initial the system, it should generate the pano image. Next step is to generate the 3 maps from the setting by
 
    ```
        sudo python xymapbuilder.py
    ```
  
  This will generate the maps for the remapping, make the code run faster. The following is the pages for taking and download the pano photos. 

  * The address for taking photos is : _ip/picam/panoindex.php_

  * The address for download photos is: _ip/picam/downloadpano.php_

  In download page, it gives the option to preview the image with VR. So if you had a VR head set and a Smart Phone, you could try with it. The default pano image I put here is the world map. 

  * The address for preview photos is: _ip/picam/previewpano.php_


## Example images

Create the pano from the my 2PiView kit using Python code, detail in genpano.py. And here is the example
